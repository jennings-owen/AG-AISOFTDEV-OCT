## 1. Executive Summary & Vision
This product, OnboardFlow, is designed to revolutionize the new hire experience by providing a centralized, personalized, and engaging platform for onboarding. It aims to solve the problem of fragmented and inefficient onboarding processes that currently lead to decreased initial productivity and increased administrative burden for HR and managers. The ultimate vision is to create a seamless, supportive, and empowering journey for every new employee, enabling them to quickly become productive, engaged, and integrated members of their teams.

## 2. The Problem
*A detailed look at the pain points this product will solve. This section justifies the project's existence.*

**2.1. Problem Statement:**
New hires currently face a fragmented and overwhelming onboarding experience, characterized by a lack of personalized guidance, difficulty finding essential information, and administrative bottlenecks, leading to delayed productivity, reduced engagement, and a high volume of repetitive questions to HR and managers. Managers, in turn, lack effective tools to track progress and proactively support their new team members.

**2.2. User Personas & Scenarios:**
[Summarize the key user personas affected by this problem. For each persona, describe a typical scenario they face that highlights the problem.]

-   **Persona 1: The Eager Contributor (New Hire)**
    *   **Scenario:** Sarah, a new Software Engineer, just joined the company. She's excited to start contributing but feels overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information. She spends valuable time searching for company policies, trying to figure out her immediate priorities, and wishes there was a clear, guided path to help her ramp up quickly and find answers independently.
-   **Persona 2: The Onboarding Orchestrator (HR Onboarding Specialist)**
    *   **Scenario:** David, an HR Onboarding Specialist, is swamped with managing dozens of new hires simultaneously. He struggles to keep track of everyone's progress, identify who needs help, and chase down incomplete HR forms. The manual process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and makes it difficult to ensure compliance and provide timely support.
-   **Persona 3: The Team Integrator (Engineering Team Lead)**
    *   **Scenario:** Maria, an Engineering Team Lead, has a new developer joining her team. She wants to ensure they get up to speed quickly and feel supported, but finding time to create custom learning plans, assign mentors, and track initial skill development is challenging. She wants a simple way to facilitate integration and assess readiness for real projects without constant manual oversight.
