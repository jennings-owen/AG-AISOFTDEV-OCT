    "\n",
    "**Task:** We will now create a Pydantic model to represent the structure of our PRD. This allows us to programmatically validate any PRD, ensuring it meets our standards before it's accepted as a formal artifact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Prompt the LLM to generate a Pydantic model that reflects the structure of the `prd_template.md`. The model should have fields for each major section (e.g., `introduction: str`, `user_personas: List[str]`, `user_stories: List[Dict]`).\n",
    "2.  Save this generated model code to a file named `app/validation_models/prd_model.py`.\n",
    "3.  While we won't write the full validation script in this lab, generating the Pydantic model itself is the key advanced step. It creates a reusable, code-based standard for our documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Quality:** A Python file containing a valid Pydantic model that can be used in the future to validate PRD documents automatically. This represents a shift from manual document review to automated governance."
