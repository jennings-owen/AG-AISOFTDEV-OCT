Our vision is to empower every new hire to become a productive and engaged contributor faster, significantly reducing ramp-up time and enhancing overall employee retention and satisfaction.\n",

    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Prompt the LLM to generate a Pydantic model that reflects the structure of the `prd_template.md`. The model should have fields for each major section (e.g., `introduction: str`, `user_personas: List[str]`, `user_stories: List[Dict]`).\n",
