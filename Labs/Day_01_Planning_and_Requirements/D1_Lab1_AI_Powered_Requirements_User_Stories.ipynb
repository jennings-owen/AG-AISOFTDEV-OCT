    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Use a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose a vague problem statement into structured features, user personas, and Agile user stories, culminating in a machine-readable JSON artifact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 90 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Welcome to the first hands-on lab of the AI-Driven Software Engineering Program! All great software projects begin with a clear understanding of the problem to be solved. In this lab, you will take on the role of a tech lead or product manager and use an LLM as a co-pilot to transform a simple, high-level problem into a set of well-defined, actionable requirements. This process is fundamental to ensuring that the team builds the *right* product.\n",

    "Our `utils.py` script is configured to work with multiple AI providers. You can change the `model_name` parameter in the `setup_llm_client()` function to any of the models listed in the `RECOMMENDED_MODELS` dictionary in `utils.py`. For example, to use a Hugging Face model, you could change the line to: `client, model_name, api_provider = setup_llm_client(model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\")`\n",

    "## Lab Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have completed the first lab. You started with a vague, one-sentence problem and finished with a structured, validated, machine-readable requirements artifact. This is the critical first step in an AI-assisted software development lifecycle. The `day1_user_stories.json` file you created will be the direct input for our next lab, where we will generate a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Takeaway:** The single most important skill demonstrated in this lab is turning unstructured ideas into structured, machine-readable data (JSON). This transformation is what enables automation and integration with other tools later in the SDLC."
