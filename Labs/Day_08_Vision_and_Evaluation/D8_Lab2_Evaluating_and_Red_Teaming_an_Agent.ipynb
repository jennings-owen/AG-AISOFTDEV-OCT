    "# Day 8 - Lab 2: Evaluating and \"Red Teaming\" an Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Evaluate the quality of the RAG agent from Day 6, implement safety guardrails to protect it, and then build a second \"Red Team\" agent to probe its defenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 90 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Building an AI agent is only half the battle. We also need to ensure it's reliable, safe, and robust. In this lab, you will first act as a QA engineer, evaluating your RAG agent's performance. Then, you'll act as a security engineer, adding guardrails to protect it. Finally, you'll take on the role of an adversarial attacker, building a \"Red Team\" agent to find weaknesses in your own defenses. This is a critical lifecycle for any production AI system.\n",

    "We will reconstruct the simple RAG chain from Day 6. This will be the \"application under test\" for this lab. We will also define a \"golden dataset\" of questions and expert-approved answers to evaluate against.\n",

    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "For the LLM-as-a-Judge and Red Team agents, a highly capable model like `gpt-4.1` or `o3` is recommended to ensure high-quality evaluation and creative attack generation.\n",

    "- `get_completion()`: To send prompts to the LLM.\n",

    "Excellent work! You have completed the full AI system lifecycle: building, evaluating, securing, and attacking. You've learned how to use LLM-as-a-Judge for automated quality scoring, how to implement critical safety guardrails, and how to use an adversarial \"Red Team\" agent to proactively discover vulnerabilities. These skills are absolutely essential for any developer building production-grade AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Takeaway:** A production-ready AI system requires more than just a good prompt; it needs a lifecycle of continuous evaluation and security testing. Using AI to automate both evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge) and security probing (Red Teaming) is a state-of-the-art practice for building robust and trustworthy agents."
