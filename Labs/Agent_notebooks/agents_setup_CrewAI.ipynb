    "# CrewAI: Orchestrating Collaborative Agent Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This notebook provides a hands-on guide to CrewAI, a framework designed for engineering sophisticated multi-agent systems. You will learn how to create a \"crew\" of autonomous AI agents that collaborate to achieve complex goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Audience:** Software engineers attending the AI-Driven Software Engineering Program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Philosophy:** CrewAI's strength lies in its intuitive, high-level abstractions for defining agents with specific roles, assigning them tasks, and defining the workflow (process) they should follow. It simplifies the creation of systems where multiple agents work together, each contributing its specialized skills."

    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- CrewAI is excellent for problems that can be broken down into distinct roles and responsibilities.\n",
    "- The `Agent`, `Task`, and `Crew` abstractions provide a clear and intuitive way to structure multi-agent systems.\n",
    "- Creating custom tools by inheriting from `BaseTool` is a reliable way to add capabilities and avoid dependency conflicts.\n",
    "- The `hierarchical` process allows for more dynamic, manager-led coordination for complex, non-linear tasks."
